###Programming Assignments
####**Homework One:** [Recursion, Loops, and Timing][1] : (ERROR)
A command-line program that tests the speed of loops versus recursion. Internal time measures the time it takes and the overhead is calculated and described in the text file.
####**Homework Two:** [Recursion, Backtracking, and Linked Lists][2] : (DEBUG)
A recursive backtracking command-line program that finds the minimum total energy on a 20-faced die given an input of the energy and cost in a textfile. Also implements a linked list of strings without STL.
####**Homework Three:** [The Social Network: Templates, Linked Lists, Classes][3] : (DEBUG)
First phase of a multi-sectioned project of a social network. This part includes creating a templated doubly linked list to store User, UserList, WallPosts, and Walls. First implementation of a class of the following. 
####**Homework Four:** [Linked List and Array Lists with Backtracking][4] : (ERROR)
This is a timing test of different types of list that expand in the following ways when a size is reached: by 1, by 10%, by 2 times. It also stress-tests the lists. This program also features a enemies / friends party invite list which finds the group of people that would be invited to the party with the fewest number of enemies.
####**Homework Five:** [Arraylist and Linked List with Stack][5] : (ERROR)
An implementation of a command-line calculator for vectors of real numbers. Using a stack, it breaks down the components and pops it off to calculate the final result.
####**Homework Six:** [The Social Network V2:Lists and Iterators ][6] : (ERROR)
Second phase of a multi-sectioned project of a social network. This part includes switching the previously implemented linked list to a more dynamically resizable array (vector). Also adds the following features of a user having friends, being able to search and send friend requests, see friends and delete friends.
####**Homework Seven:** [Heap, D-arrays, and Priority Queues][7] : (ERROR)
A first implementation of a heap. We examine a d-ary tree and manage insertions and removals. In addition, we implement a templated priority queue as a heap based on a complete d-ary tree.
####**Homework Eight:** [The Social Network V3: Sorting and Pointer Functions][8] : (DEBUG)
Third phase of a multi-sectioned project of a social network. This part includes sorting friends and the use of pointer functions. Additional features include commenting on wall posts, deleting wall posts, sorting posts and stress-testing the user database.
####**Homework Nine:** [Quicksort and 2-3 Tree][9] : (ERROR)
In this program, we use a sorting algorithm to count the most common iteration of string, find two numbers in a text file that add to a user-set number and implement a 2-3 tree of a student's GPA and ID. 
####**Homework Ten:** [Hash Tables][10] : (ERROR)
This program implements the use of a templated hash table to store a key and value. We store in the student's name and the corresponding GPA and manage to sort that out using a hash table. Similarly, we tackle the previous programming assigment probelm of finding two numbers in a text file that adds to a certain sum. We also test the speed of hash tables in searching a query (similar to Google's search).
####**Homework Eleven:** [The Social Network V4: MD5, Hash, Games and Depth First Search][11]
Fourth and final phase of a multi-sectioned project of a social network. Here we add a hashing algorithmm MD5, that saves the password in a hashtable. We check the degree of seperation between two users and additionally add a feature of our own. This program's additional feature includes a game, Hangman with a leaderboard.
