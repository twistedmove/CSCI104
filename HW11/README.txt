My implementation is a game center which now features hangman. You can play the game and the word list is imported from hangman.txt. I keep track of game points and in the future could implement additional games to create a leaderboard. And yes, I do show who is the top leader with how many points they're leading by.


I've got everything working my program exits strangely after trying to access/delete(?) something from the stack. I'm not sure what's going on.
