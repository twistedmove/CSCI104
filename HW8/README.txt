I have everything implemented except I can't seem to import the friends and pendingfriends database correctly. 
I spoke with Kaveh at Tuesday lab except I didn't have a functioning debugger working on Eclipse and it was difficult for him to understand the error. He knows of the problem except wasn't sure why it worked for one time and doesn't work two lines after. It also runs into a hanging error when I push_back the user created at the end of parsing.

My function somehow imports correctly for my user wall posts but fails to import the database for friends and pendingfriends which prevents me to "accept" using a different user.

I would preferably hope that the grader would look at my code to understand the logic and structure behind my code.
All of the functionality works except for the pendingfriends and friends part.

Please email me at bryancho@usc.edu if there's any problem otherwise I might need to bother the instructors again with a regrade.
Much appreciated,

Bryan
