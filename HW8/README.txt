I've got the sorting working except it peeks and removes, it seg faults because it strangely picks up a 0x0 null pointer to one of the child. Not sure what the problem is but would greatly appreciate it if it's possible to find!

I'll fix it in the future, but I'd appreciate it if I can get points, even if I'm deducted for not implementing it fully. 
Every point counts!

Thank you.
