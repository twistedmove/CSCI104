I haven't gotten the full implementation the functional pointers to sort my algorithm, but I got most of the base down, so could you please kindly look at my .h and .cpp files for sorting.h and mergesort.h mergesort.cpp and allocate points according to how I got the framework but not necessarily the program functioning?

I'll fix it in the future, but I'd appreciate it if I can get points, even if I'm deducted. 
Every point counts!

Thank you.
